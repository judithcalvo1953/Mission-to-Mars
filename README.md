# Mission-to-Mars
I have completed this to the best of my efforts.  I was able to scrape the web. The only thing that does not work well is the rendering of the Mars Hemispheres on the index.html web page.  I followed the guidance of my tutor in crafting the code to extact the pictures, but apparently, I did not get any pictures back.
